shonspostcategories
===================

This is a WordPress plugin that let's you display links to all the posts in a certain category at the bottom of a page.

It gives you a metabox on the page add/edit screen that let's you show it on that page (or not show it) and then choose
the category to display posts for.

To do for future updates:
  [ ] Allow multiple categories
  [ ] Ability to choose hierarchy for those categories
  [ ] ability to customize the template used for the list
  [ ] Title option for the section that displays the list
  [ ] provide the option on posts as well
  [ ] ability to choose tags also (not just categories)

This is a WordPress plugin that let's you display links to all the posts in a certain category at the bottom of a page.

It gives you a metabox on the page add/edit screen that let's you show it on that page (or not show it) and then choose
the category to display posts for.

Add this plugin by uploading the zip using the "Add Plugin" feature built into Wordpress.  Otherwise manaully unzip the folder
and upload the entire directory to your blog's plugins folder ( /wp-content/plugins/ ).  Next you have to activate the plugin.

Alternatively you could just go to "Add Plugin" and search for the Wordpress.org Plugins and directly install it from there.

Whenever you are editing a post or a page you will see a metabox in the upper right-hand corner where you can toggle displaying or not displaying the post list.

You can set some other options there as well, such as the category for posts you want to display, how many posts to display, whether or not to show an excerpt, and how many words long the excerpt should be.
